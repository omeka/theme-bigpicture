                The Apollo 15 Learning Hub is a project in the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship that has as its
                mission to assemble, preserve, and make available primary source records of Apollo 15 for research,
                education, and preservation as an example of a unique human endeavor. The Hub offers access to a digital
                archive of Apollo 15 onboard materials, an interactive 3D model of the Lunar Module, as well as links to
                reliable primary sources of Apollo history. In this section of the Apollo 15 Learning Hub, we present
                information about the flight path of Apollo 15 to the Moon and back. The original flight documents
                presented here are part of the Learning Hub’s collection and were provided by Commander David R. Scott.

                NASA’s Apollo program started in the 1960s and continued into the early 1970s, achieving the first and only human missions around the moon, including six lunar landing missions, with the first moon landing of Apollo 11 being the most famous. The Apollo 15 mission was the fourth lunar landing mission and the first extended scientific exploration of the moon. The Apollo 15 mission involved several groundbreaking scientific experiments as well as innovative space travel features.
              </p>
              <p data-aos="fade-in">
                The four primary objectives of the Apollo 15 mission in terms of science and engineering were to explore
                the Hadley-Apennine region of the Moon, set up and activate surface scientific experiments, make
                engineering evaluations of new Apollo equipment, and conduct lunar orbital experiments and photographic
                tasks .

               The crew of Apollo 15 was now embarking on the next phase – the first extended scientific exploration of the Moon -- NASA was to term our mission “the most complex and carefully planned expeditions in the history of exploration.” (Scott, 2011:p.1)  </blockquote>

                On March 26, 1970 NASA announced the crew for Apollo 15, which was planned to be the fifth Moon landing

                Alfred M. Worden, and James B. Irwin.

                The Apollo 15 crew and their backups underwent training that lasted about 20 months before their
                mission. Part of that training took place in Antarctica for a habitability study in January 1970, as the
                following video donated by Commander David Scott shows.

                Extensive geology training was another part of the process, with training exercises in the Orocopia Mountains and the Mojave Desert in California and the area around Flagstaff, Arizona, among other places. Apollo 15 would also be the first mission to utilize the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) to enable the astronauts to travel farther from their Lunar Module to explore areas of geologic interest.

                The Apollo 15 mission launch date had been scheduled for July 26, 1971. The last few weeks before the
                launch, the astronauts’ training as it related to the launch and everything else about the mission had
                intensified. Every detail about the flight plan, the Command and Service Module (CSM), the plan of
                action after the CSM had left the Earth’s atmosphere was exhaustively examined and checked.

                The Apollo 15 crew and their backups had been placed in quarantine for two weeks before the launch to
                ensure that they would not contract any viruses and that they would be in peak physical condition at the
                time of the flight. On the day of the launch, the crew started their day by undergoing a thorough
                physical exam by the mission doctors.

                Scott, Worden, and Irwin were helped into their spacesuits several hours before the launch. They had to

                which took the whole morning of that day. Finally, the three crew members entered the CSM. After the crew had entered the CSM a new round of checks followed.

                The ascent of the spacecraft was one of the most dangerous parts of the whole mission. There were a
                number of things that could go wrong during this phase that could force Commander Scott to take the
                decision to abort the mission. What made this part of the flight even more stressful was the difficulty

                be activated was less than a second.

As a result, using a rover to explore multiple geologic areas at one landing site became almost equivalent to exploring multiple landing sites without a rover. Correspondingly, subsequent Apollo crews became even more proficient in “planetary field geology.” (Scott, 2008:p.XXIX)

                    Despite the usefulness of the lunar rover, the astronauts conducted most of their geology exploration
                    of the Moon’s surface walking, which turned out be rather challenging given the lower gravity of the
                    Moon.
                </p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in">
                    One of the most important aspects of the Apollo 15 mission was the study of the Moon’s geology, which
                    was still not well understood at the time of the mission. Astronauts Scott and Irwin collected several
                    samples during their EVAs. Among the rocks they collected was one that was later dubbed the “Genesis
                    Rock.” It was a very pure specimen of anorthosite, a type of rock believed to have floated like
                    icebergs in the magma oceans that constituted the Moon’s outer layers early in its history. It was
                    found to be more than 4 billion years old and was the most ancient whole rock recovered from the lunar
                    surface to that point. The prospect of finding such rocks was one reason the landing site had been
                    selected (NASA 1971, Apollo 15 Mission Report).
                </p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in">
                    Another important objective of the mission was the experiments conducted on the surface of the Moon with the help of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP). The ALSEP consisted of a set of scientific instruments placed at the landing site by the astronauts.  One of the components of the ALSEP, the Solar-Wind Spectrometer, measured the fluxes and spectra of the electrons and protons that emanate from the Sun and reach the lunar surface (NASA, 1971i). The ALSEP instruments were arrayed around a central station which supplied power to run the instruments and communications so data collected by the experiments could be relayed to Earth.
                </p>
                <p data-aos="fade-in">
                    Data collected from the instruments were converted into a telemetry format and transmitted to Earth. The ALSEP system and instruments were controlled by commands from Earth (NASA 1971, Apollo 15 Mission Report).

                    At the end of the final EVA, Scott performed a televised sequel to the experiment Galileo is purported
                    to have conducted at the Tower of Pisa. He dropped a hammer and a feather together in the lunar vacuum
                    and observed that they struck the ground at the same time (NASA 1971, Apollo 15 Mission Report). Commander Scott describes how he conducted
                    the experiment:

                On August 2, the Lunar Module fired its ascent stage engine and lifted off the Moon for its rendezvous with
                Command Module, or CM, Endeavor. For the first time, the lunar liftoff was seen on Earth via the LRV
                television camera. The two spacecraftsdocked as Endeavor began its 50th lunar orbit. On the 74th
                revolution, the Particles and Fields sub satellite was spring-launched from the service module bay. On the
                next revolution, on August 4, a two-minute, 21-second propulsion system burn put Apollo 15 on its path back to
                Earth (NASA 1971, Apollo 15 Mission Report).

                At approximately 4:46 p.m. EDT on August 7, Apollo 15 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, about 335 miles
                north of Honolulu, ending a flight of 12 days, seven hours. The crew was picked up by helicopters from
                the prime recovery ship, the USS Okinawa, 6.32 miles from the targeted touchdown point (NASA 1971, Apollo 15 Mission Report).

                Conclusion</h2>
              <p data-aos="fade-in">
                The return of the Apollo 15 mission included a long series of talks and presentations for the crew
                members who were informed about the accomplishments of their mission regarding the scientific
                experiments they had conducted, as well as the engineering and other technical achievements.
              </p>
              <p data-aos="fade-in">
              Apollo 15 set several new records for crewed spaceflight: heaviest payload in a lunar orbit of approximately 107,000 pounds, maximum radial distance traveled on the lunar surface away from the spacecraft of about 17.5 miles (previous high was 2.1 miles on Apollo 14), most lunar surface EVAs (three) and longest total of duration for lunar surface EVAs (18 hours, 37 minutes - almost the total time spent in lunar orbit by Apollo 8), longest time in lunar orbit (about 145 hours; only two hours less than the entire Apollo 8 mission), longest crewed lunar mission (295 hours), longest Apollo mission (295 hours - previous high was 244 hours, 36 minutes on Apollo 12), the first satellite placed in lunar orbit by a crewed spacecraft, and first deep space and operational EVA (NASA 1971, Apollo 15 Mission Report).

                The samples that the mission brought back had been deemed as especially valuable by NASA scientists and
                it would turn out to be one of the more noteworthy contributions of the Apollo 15 mission. -Dimitri
